#Thanksgiving Weekend Scrums

##Morning Scrum - 2013.12.01 - 11:00 am

###What did I do yesterday?
  * I completed 17 exercises of Learn Ruby the hard way.  I worked on trying to import the data from the learning objectives google spreadsheet.  I used the Roo gem and instructions from a Railscast (#396).  I could not get it to work, so I downloaded the google sheet and saved as a CSV.  I was getting different errors, It does feel close.  If I can't get that to work quickly today, I will go back to how we did it in class.  I also updated the learning objectives links a bit.

###What are you planning to do today?
  * Today will be a purposely slower day.  I have worked pretty hard over the last few days a need to scale back a bit before launching into week 11.  Every day is getting more and more critical. However, as stated in an earlier scrum, this is still a marathon.  Learning something everyday is more important that plowing through a lots of material and retaining none of it.  That said I would like to get through at least 5 more Learning the hard way exercises and get the objectives displayed in my app.  I will also scan through our class hip chat and add links in the misc section

###Any Obstacles?
  * Fighting myself.  I need to keep the long term goal in mind and continue to break down what I need to learn on a given day.

##Morning Scrum - 2013.11.30 - 8:30 am

###What did I do yesterday?
  * Yesterday I worked on setting up the app that will show WDI learning objectives.  I will able to set up the rails app and the model/table.  I was also able to seed the database and show the results on the index page.  The last things I did with the app was set it up so I could import the data from the google docs spreadsheet.  The code is there but to tested yet.  I used a RailsCast to walk me through this process.  I also did some small edits to my learning obs links GitHub repo.

###What are you planning to do today?
  * Continue to work on the Learning objectives rails app.  I will also go back to basics today.  I am going to work through Ruby the Hard way the PDF version online.  There are 52 exercises.  It’s hard to know how long/short the exercises are.  For today at a minimum I would like to complete 10 and hope to get to as many as 15 exercises.  Again learning is the goal.  Eat your fold slowly and digest, if you eat to fast it will all come up!!

###Any Obstacles?
  * I just need to relax and learn at my own pace.  It’s been a good couple of days.  Finish these next two days strong and you will feel much better going into next week.

##Morning Scrum - 2013.11.29 - 8:40 am

###What did I do yesterday?
  * I created a rails app that will display all of our learning objectives and enable people to track themselves.  I'm using this app to work through different aspects of the Ruby language.  I also added some more detail on Git and Github to the WDI Learning Objective Links file.

###What are you planning to do today?
  * Continue to work on the Learning objectives rails all.  Working on rails concepts including, but not limited to the following:
   * Ruby basics and strings
   * Ruby collections and enumeration
   * Ruby control flow
   * Ruby methods
   * Ruby Objects

###Any Obstacles?
  * NONE.  Get it done!!

##Morning Scrum - 2013.11.28 - 5:00 am

###What did I do yesterday?
  * I worked through the command line and Git and GitHub.  I started on Ruby Basics.  I also created a GitHub repo with links to resources for the command line, Git and GitHub.  The writeup was done in Sublime using the Markdown language.

###What are you planning to do today?
  * On the Objectives side I am going to work through:
   * Ruby Basics & Strings
   * Ruby Collections & Enumeration

  * I will also begin the following project:
   * Build a rails app that will show all of our objectives
   * It will be a simple 1 model/table app (for now)
   * I will import the data from the objectives file
   * Display it in the browser

###Any Obstacles?
  * First and foremost is patience.  The basic skills are just not as embedded within me as much as I feel they should be!  It's not how much I get through this weekend it's how much I retain.  Building a strong foundation is the most important thing.  This is still a marathon.
   * Major Check-in Points:
      * December 19 - Final Project
      * January 14 - Career Event: Meet & Greet
      * January 28 - Career Event: Apprenticeship Interviews

   * Slow and steady will still win this race!!
   * Time is also an obstacle today.  We are going to dinner at 2:30.  It's not realistic that I will get anything done tonight.  However I still have three full days after today, so march on!!

###Any Obstacles?
  * At this point the main obstacle is time.  I'm sure that more will happen on the journey (of course they will that's the point!)
