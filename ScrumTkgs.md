#Thanksgiving Weekend Scrums

##Morning Scrum 2013.11.28 - 5:00 am

###What did I do yesterday?
  * I worked through the command line and Git and GitHub.  I started on Ruby Basics.  I also created a GitHub repo with links to resources for the command line, Git and GitHub.  The writeup was done in Sublime using the Markdown language.

###What are you planning to do today?
  * On the Objectives side I am going to work through:
   * Ruby Basics & Strings
   * Ruby Collections & Enumeration

  * I will also begin the following project:
   * Build a rails app that will show all of our objectives
   * It will be a simple 1 model/table app (for now)
   * I will import the data from the objectives file
   * Display it in the browser

###Any Obstacles?
  * First and foremost is patience.  The basic skills are just not as embedded within me as much as I feel they should be!  It's not how much I get through this weekend it's how much I retain.  Building a strong foundation is the most important thing.  This is still a marathon.
   * Major Check-in Points:
      * December 19 - Final Project
      * January 14 - Career Event: Meet & Greet
      * January 28 - Career Event: Apprenticeship Interviews

   * Slow and steady will still win this race!!
   * Time is also an obstacle today.  We are going to dinner at 2:30.  It's not realistic that I will get anything done tonight.  However I still have three full days after today, so march on!!
